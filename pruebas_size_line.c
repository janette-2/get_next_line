/* LINE_SIZE

Analizes the original text, byte by byte, and returns
the amount of bytes that were found in a single line
before jumping to the next one or before the text ends.

Notes:--------------------------
The EOF is identified by the int that read() returns.
If you obtain a 0, there's nothing to read, so you have 
finished the file. 
If you get a -1, there is an error with the file or
it doesn't exist. 
Notes: -------------------------------
In the while is important to FIRST check if the reading has been done,
with the amount of bytes copied. This will also fill the buffer 
read_one[0] BEFORE analizing the content inside of it.*/
